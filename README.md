# 🏆 Spin the Wheel Leaderboard

This is a gamified leaderboard for monthly deals.  
It syncs live with Google Sheets and displays rankings with medals, progress bars, and Slack profile pictures.

## Deployment
1. Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io).
2. Upload this repo (or connect GitHub).
3. Set the entrypoint file to `leaderboard.py`.
4. Share your Streamlit link with agents.

## Notes
- The Google Sheet must remain publicly shareable (via CSV export).
- Update the sheet → the leaderboard updates in real-time.
